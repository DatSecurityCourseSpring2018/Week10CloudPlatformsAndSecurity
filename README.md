# Week 10 - Choosing the Application Architecture and Deployment Strategy and its influence on Security

This weeks topics are focused around how the architecture of our application,more precisely the deployment architecture, influences the security of our application.

Up until now, we have introduced you to the hardest deployment infrastructure, (Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS), which have costed you a lot of hard work (hopefully you learned a lot while doing ig) when we deployed our applications.
But who will be in charge of the future maintenance of the application, security patches, security updates etc. This is the topics for this week.

### Read/Watch

- Watch this [Serverless Security: Whatâ€™s Left To Protect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiyUD_rI8D8) 
- Skim this article [Serverless Architectures](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) 
- Use Google and make sure that you, before the lesson, has an idea about the meaning behinds the terms: IaaS, PaaS, (SaaS), FaaS, Baas and Serverles, and why these topics are included in a security course

## Tuesdays plan
We will discuss the most of the topics in the class, and summarize introduce the concepts: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and the newer ones FaaS, BaaS and "Serverles".
